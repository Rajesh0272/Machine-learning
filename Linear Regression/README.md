This is a linear regression jupyter notebook which is done on canada_per_capita_income dataset. At first i had plotted scatterplot of each independent feature to the target feature and they are linearly related with each other which can be seen in scatterplot.


And also i had taken another dataset ie. Homeprices dataset which has categotical feature in it and performed ONEHOTENCODING on it and seen the linear relation between independent feature and target feature by plotting the scatter plot.

Note: Here i have used train_test_split for Carprices dateset only.
